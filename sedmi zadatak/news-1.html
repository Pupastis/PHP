			<h2>Velebit hiking trail</h2>
			<p class="description">9-day trekking through the most beautiful croatian mountain.</p>
			<p>The mountain Velebit belongs to the mountain Dinaride system and it is its longest mountain.</p>
			<p>In the same time, Velebit is the most interesting and the richest natural landscape in Croatia. In order to protect these values, whole Velebit was declared as nature park, and its most precious landscapes are protected as national parks, strict reserves and nature monuments..</p>
			<p>Velebit hiking trail (Velebitski planinarski put, VPP) is the mountain trail leading through the most interesting landscapes of Velebit. The trail starts on Zavižan to where the shortest approaches are from Oltari and Krasno (3-4 h). Some hikers tend to divide the trip in two parts, with break on Baške Oštarije. The trail ends at Starigrad Paklenica on Adriatic highway. Route of the Velebit hiking trail is about 100 km long and is marked with usual red-white mountaineer signs.</p>
			<p>To pass the entire route of VPP 9 days of walking are needed. The traveling is divided into 9 units of equable length, depending on possibilities of a night's accommodation. In addition to VPP, on Velebit there are also numerous other mountain paths, marked to enable shorter trips according to wishes. The most beautiful parts of Velebit hiking trail are the area between Zavižan and Alan (North Velebit) and National Park Paklenica on South Velebit. Croatian Mountaineering Association (Hrvatski planinarski savez, www.hps.hr / hps@hps.hr) takes care about Velebit hiking trail.</p>
